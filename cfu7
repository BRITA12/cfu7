'''Create a program that asks the user for three numbers.The main program should send those three numbers as arguments to a function to calculates and prints “The sum of your three numbers is:  XXX”The main program should then send those same numbers to a second function which calculates and prints “The average of your three numbers is:  XXX”'''

num1 = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
num2 = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
num3 = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

def sum_function(x,y,z):
    sums = x + y + z
    print("The sum of your three numbers is: ", sums)
    
def avg_function(x,y,z):
    average = (x + y + z) / 3
    print("The average of your three numbers is: ", average)
    
sum_function(num1, num2, num3)
avg_function(num1, num2, num3)
